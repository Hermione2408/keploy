# Platform Package Documentation

It exposes a set of interfaces and methods for common data store 
operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) 
records. 

We can add the implemetation for different types of data stores
here in onle place which is abstrated from other logic using interface
methods. 

This package dependes upon the `models` package to use the structs for 
performing the CRUD operations.
